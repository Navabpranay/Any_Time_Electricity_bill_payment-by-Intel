## Project Description
Anytime Electricity Bill Payment (ATP) is a system designed to allow customers to pay electricity bills 24/7 using various payment modes (Cash / DD / Cheque). The system captures the bill/voucher data, displays it to the user, handles cash in different denominations, validates notes, processes payments, and provides acknowledgment after successful transactions.

## Key Features
- Supports cash, DD, and cheque payments.
- Captures bill/voucher details using barcode scanning.
- Accepts only valid notes (‚Çπ10, ‚Çπ20, ‚Çπ50, ‚Çπ100, ‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ500).
- Rejects soiled, torn, wet, or oiled notes and coins.
- Handles excess payments (adjusted in future bills) and short payments (may lead to disconnection).
- Issues a transaction acknowledgment to customers.

## State Machine (FSM)
ATP follows a 5-state FSM:
1. **Idle State** ‚Äì Waiting for user interaction.
2. **Prompt State** ‚Äì Prompting for input on the touchscreen.
3. **Scan State** ‚Äì Scanning voucher barcodes.
4. **Payment State** ‚Äì Handling cash insertion and payment confirmation.
5. **Acknowledgment State** ‚Äì Issuing acknowledgment after successful payment.

## Modules Implemented
- **User Interface Module:** Handles touchscreen and button interactions.
- **Barcode Scanner Module:** Captures barcode/voucher data.
- **Cash Handling Module:** Validates and accepts inserted cash.
- **Payment Processing Module:** Calculates bill adjustment, detects excess or short payments.
- **Acknowledgment Module:** Issues acknowledgment after successful transactions.
- **ATP System Module:** Top-level system integration of all modules.

## Approach
1. Basic understanding of ATP functionality.
2. Learned Verilog HDL language.
3. Created a block diagram and FSM.
4. Developed and tested code modules.
5. Created a complete Testbench for simulation.
6. Compiled and validated the design.
7. Documented the project thoroughly.
8. Uploaded the project to GitHub.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **Tools:** ModelSim / Xilinx / Vivado (or any preferred FPGA simulation tool)
